## Prerequisites
While you do not need to know any python or programming languages to attend this workshop, you will need to have the following prerequisites met before attending.

### GitHub Account
GitHub allows you to host static pages such as this one you are viewing right now, store project code and collaborate with project team members. If you do not currently have a GitHub user account, please [register here](https://github.com/) before the workshop begins. Please make sure you remember you username and password.

### Internet Browser
You will also need to be able to access the internet through relatively up-to-date browser such as Chrome, Safari or Firefox.

## Technology used in creating workshop
Below is a list of the all the technology/software I used in creating workshop materials. If you plan to attend other workshops that require the same tools, you shoud consider installing them now and reaching out to a Resbaz facilitor, helper or instructor if you need help with installation. If you are not sure how much you will use these tools, I would recommend attending the workshop with only prequisites (listed above) and see what you may think will be useful for you in the future. There are weekly Resbaz events on campus (virtual until further notice with COVID-19) called "Coffee and Code" and "Hacky Hour" where you can find support anytime of the year.

### Bash Shell: 
Allows you to interface with your computer and do lots of cool stuff. 
Select your operating system:
- **Windows:** Download [Git for Windows installer](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- **MacOS:** The default shell in all versions of macOS is Bash, so no need to install anything. You access Bash from the Terminal (found in `/Applications/Utilities`). 
- **Linux:** The default shell is usually Bash, but if your machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a terminal and typing bash. There is no need to install anything.

### Anaconda
Anaconda gives you access to open source software where you can utilize Python to begin your programming projects. The Jupyter Notebooks that we will be working with were created using Anaconda.
